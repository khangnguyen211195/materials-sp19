    "## Homework 1 (Part A) ##\n",
    "Starting in Week 2, each homework will have two parts, A (written work only) and B (also involving code). In Week 1 we just have part A; there's no part B.\n",

    "#### How to Do Your Homework ####\n",
    "The point of homework is for you to try your hand at using what you've learned in class. The steps to follow:\n",
    "- Go to lecture, and also go over the relevant text sections **before** starting on the homework. This will remind you what was covered in class, and the text will typically contain examples not covered in lecture. The weekly Preparation Guide will list what you should read.\n",
    "- Go to discussion section and work on some of the practice problems **before** starting on the homework. \n",
    "- Attempt the homework problems **by yourself** with the text, discussion section work, and practice materials all at hand. Sometimes the week's lab will help as well. The two steps above will help this step go faster and be more fruitful.\n",
    "- At this point, seek help if you need it. Don't ask how to do the problem â€“ ask how to get started, or for a nudge to get you past where you are stuck.\n",
    "- For a good measure of your understanding, keep track of the fraction of the homework you can do by yourself or with minimal help. It's a better measure than your homework score, and only you can measure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules for Written Homework ####\n",
    "- Every answer should contain a calculation or reasoning. For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)(0.8) + (2/3)(0.7)$ is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ is not fine; write \"we need 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mut. excl.\"\n",
    "- You may consult others (see \"How to Do Your Homework\" above) but you must write up your own answers using your own words, notation, and sequence of steps.\n",
    "- We'll be using Gradescope. **Answer each question on a separate page. If a question contains multiple parts, all the parts should be on the same page, clearly labeled. Put your name on the top of every page.**\n",
    "- You must submit the homework according to the instructions in Problem 6 below.\n",

    "### 1. Bootstrap Samples ###\n",
    "A sample consists of $n$ people. As you know from Data 8, a bootstrap sample consists of $n$ people drawn at random with replacement from the original sample.\n",

    "### 2. Cards from a Deck ###\n",
    "A standard deck consists of 52 cards, of which 26 are red and 26 black. The black cards consist of 13 clubs and 13 spades. The red cards consist of 13 diamonds and 13 hearts. \n",

    "Cards are dealt at random without replacement. Let $R_n$ be the event that the $n$th card dealt is red, and let $B_n$ be the event that the $n$th card dealt is black.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Simple Random Sampling ###\n",
    "A *simple random sample* is a sample drawn from a finite population at random without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $k$, $n$, and $N$ be integers such that $0 < k < n < N$. Suppose a simple random sample of size $n$ is drawn from the population. That implies all ${N \\choose n}$ samples are equally likely, as we will show later in the course. You can assume it for now. \n",

    "Also suppose that $k$ of the $N$ elements of the population are golden.\n",

    "### 5. Exactly Half Heads ###\n",
    "The results of $n$ tosses of a coin can be thought of as a sequence of length $n$, where each element of the sequence is either H or T. One way of describing a fair coin is to say that for each fixed $n$, all such sequences are equally likely.\n",

    "Let $m$ be a positive integer. Use Stirling's formula to approximate the chance of getting exactly $m$ heads in $2m$ tosses of a fair coin, and say what the limit is as $m \\to \\infty$. Later in the course we will see why this doesn't contradict the law of averages.\n",
