    "What you have learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of people at Table 1 grows in a predictable way after some randomness in the early stages.\n",
    "- If Table 1 gets rich, then it gets richer.\n",
    "- The proportion of people at Table 1 has a limit, and the distribution of the limit is a member of the beta family.\n",
    "- There's got to be a reason why the beta density appears; the cliff-hanger is resolved in this week's homework, via the beta-binomial process.\n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced analyses of the Chinese Restaurant process include descriptions the joint distribution of the proportions at all the tables. These are related to the *Dirichlet-multinomial* process, which is the multivariate version of the beta-binomial process. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's late in the semester and we don't have time to go into all that. But you can skim [a description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_restaurant_process) of the Chinese Restaurant process, in which you will spot a lot that is familiar and a lot that isn't. For an illuminating exposition, read the first few pages of [a much-cited paper](https://cocosci.berkeley.edu/tom/papers/ncrp.pdf) by Blei, Griffiths, and Jordan. "
