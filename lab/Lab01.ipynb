    "Hash functions play a major role in cryptography and computer security. For example, servers verify passwords by comparing the hash value of an entered string with the hash value stored in a database. *Birthday attacks* take advantage of the birthday paradox to generate hash collisions and trick computers into accepting a malicious file in place of a previously-encountered safe file. \n",

    "Note that the attackers don't aim to collide with a *specific* hash value – they just try for a collision with any assigned value. In other words, the goal is to get any match, just as in the birthday problem. If the assigned values can be modeled by random draws and the attackers are also drawing at random, then our birthday problem approximations apply."
