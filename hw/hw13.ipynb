    "Your homework has two components: A (written work only) and B (also involving code). Each question or subpart is labeled accordingly. Written work should be completed on paper, and coding questions should be done in the notebook. It is your responsibility to ensure that your homework is submitted completely and properly to Gradescope. Refer to the bottom of the notebook for submission instructions.\n",

    "- Every answer should contain a calculation or reasoning. For example, a calculation such as $(1/3)(0.8) + (2/3)(0.7)$ is fine without further explanation or simplification. If we want you to simplify, we'll ask you to. But just ${5 \\choose 2}$ is not fine; write \"we need 2 out of the 5 frogs and they can appear in any order\" or whatever reasoning you used. Reasoning can be brief and abbreviated, e.g. \"product rule\" or \"not mut. excl.\"\n",
    "- You may consult others but you must write up your own answers using your own words, notation, and sequence of steps.\n",
    "- In the interest of saving trees, you do not need to *solve* each question on a new piece of paper. Folding the paper to show just the relevant problem will suffice. To ensure the correct page size, we recommend placing the folded part on a blank page before scanning, or adjusting the page settings on your phone scanning app.\n",
    "- You will submit a scanned PDF to Gradescope. **Each question should *start* on a new PDF page. No page should contain two questions.**\n",

    "#### Rules for Coding ####\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not share, copy, or allow others to copy your code. You may discuss your approach and relevant methods or functions to use.\n",
    "- A code cell (which may contain starter code) is provided for each question or subpart that requires coding. You are free to add additional cells as needed.\n",
    "- You will submit a PDF to Gradescope. See the bottom of the notebook for more instructions.\n",
